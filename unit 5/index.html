			<p>Hello there! I am a Visual Designer living life one pizza at a time. A Virginia native, I moved to Austin Texas in 2010 to pursue a degree in poetry. Somewhere along the way I discovered my love for graphic design and began teaching myself code as well as Abode Creative Suite. Formerly a sales associate at OutboundEngine I was able to move into the marketing department after six months with the company where I provide graphic support for everything from email campaigns to advertisements to our product.</p> 

			<p>More than mildly obsessed with UX design, I am grateful that my design experience is so heavily tied to marketing our product. I work directly with our engineering department to help find solutions to issues with our software or integration with our social platforms and our Online Marketing Manager to produce advertisements with compelling imagery and CTAs.</p> 

			<p>Finding a solution, whether it is to a problem or to an anticipated need of a client is one of the most rewarding parts of my job, and doing so with great design that is both visually stunning and easy to use is the type of work I proudly attach my name to.</p>
